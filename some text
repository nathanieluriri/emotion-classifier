If anger is represented by only 6%, it still generally falls within the category of negative emotions. However, it's worth noting that emotions are complex, and individual interpretations can vary. In some contexts, a very low percentage of anger might be interpreted as a minimal or mild negative emotional state, possibly overshadowed by other emotions.

Keep in mind that the classification of emotions is subjective and can be influenced by cultural, personal, and contextual factors. In a broad sense, though, any percentage of anger is likely to be perceived as a negative emotion, even if it's relatively low.
